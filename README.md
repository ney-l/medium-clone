## Best practices

- Keep components as many components as dumb as possible for better testing and predictability. Make only a selected few into Smart Components.
- Keep files small.
- Use descriptive and consistent names for variables, files, etc.
- Abstract out code into smaller reusuable functions or components as much as possible
- Avoid code duplication
- Follow naming conventions
- Use absolute imports by configuring path aliases to avoid `../../../../../` nightmare
- Favicon support keeping the operating system in mind that display it differently.
- Sensible folder structure
